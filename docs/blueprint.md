# **App Name**: FreshView

## Core Features:

- Traceability Tracking: Input traceability data for goods.
- Cold Chain Monitoring: Track and log the temperature of goods during transit, generating alerts for deviations outside acceptable thresholds.
- CRM Dashboard: Display key customer metrics, interaction history, and relevant order information to enhance customer relationship management.
- Anomaly Detection: Use generative AI to find deviations from established standard metrics for key aspects of the FreshTrack data model, by integrating sensor data. Display an alert if a threshold has been exceeded. Use a generative AI 'tool' to create the plain-English explanation of the reasoning used to justify flagging a potential problem. 
- Integrated VMS/IoT Data Display: Visualize real-time data from VMS and IoT devices within the FreshView interface, providing a consolidated view of location, status, and environmental conditions.
- Alert Management: Configure and manage alerts for critical events such as temperature excursions, delivery delays, and security breaches.
- Report Generation: Generate detailed reports on product traceability, cold chain compliance, and overall system performance.
